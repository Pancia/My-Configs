- better syntax/format for TODO files (search online?)
    should at least support tagging/priority & have a vim plugin
- show todos on entering project
    also search/grep for TODO markers
- vim use nvr so its like server emacs ... dont have to start a new one up every time
- vims should support subcommands, eg `vims` `vims help` `vims list` `vims edit [name]` & any user defined ones, eg: `vims git` `vims server` `vims client`
- show `vims list` on entering a project that has vims entries
- `vims edit` template? or at least a banner with help / common patterns, eg: terminal zsh -is eval "..."
- the `help` command should print doc(strings), so you know wtf it is
- the `help` command should tell you how to use it and any variants/subcommands
- shada (neovim cache/save thingy?) causes slowdown...
- stop using youcompleteme, see if speedup
- _gitignore_to_regex should use .ignore
- _gitignore_to_regex should remove trailing slashes when joining lines
