- better syntax/format for TODO files (search online?)
    should at least support tagging/priority & have a vim plugin
- create cd wrapper (like smartcd/vims)
    - show todos on entering project also search/grep for TODO markers
    - show `vims list` on entering a project that has vims entries
- vim use nvr so its like server emacs ... dont have to start a new one up every time
- shada (neovim cache/save thingy?) causes slowdown...
- stop using youcompleteme, see if speedup
